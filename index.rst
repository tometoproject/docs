Welcome to Tometo's documentation!
==================================

This is the central documentation for the `Tometo <https://tometo.org>`_
project. You can use the sidebar to navigate this page!

We provide documentation for a couple of different things:

- **Want to learn how to install Tometo locally** to work on it or to just try
  it out for yourself? Our :doc:`Installation Guide</installation>` can help!
- **Interested in contributing to Tometo?** We have a couple of guides related
  to that :doc:`here!</contributing/index>`
- **Questions about Phabricator, our internal development platform?** We have
  some extensive :doc:`guides available!<phabricator/index>`
- We also provide some :doc:`**technical details about our code structure**<technical/api>`.
