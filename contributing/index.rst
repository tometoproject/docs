Contributing to Tometo
======================

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Tometo! There is more than one way
to contribute to the project, and we appreciate all of them.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the `Tometo Discord Server <https://discord.gg/xqTEcaw>`_.
As a reminder, all contributors, in whichever way, are required to follow the `Code of Conduct <https://docs.tometo.org/conduct>`_.

Feature Requests
----------------

If you have ideas or even concrete suggestions for a feature or an enhancement, it's best
to discuss it first on Discord before diving into the specifics. If you feel up to implement it,
first :doc:`create a task for it </contributing/bug>` and then make a
:ref:`contribution <code-contributions>`!

Bug Reports
-----------

While we wish everything in here worked perfectly, bugs are natural to occur.
This is why we recommend that, even when you're not sure it's a bug, to report it anyways.

Please see :doc:`How to report a bug </contributing/bug>` for more info about
bug reports.
